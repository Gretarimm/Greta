		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<p><strong class="strong">Important! After you receive gold, never trade it back to anyone. Anybody who is claiming to work for us and who is asking for your gold back is a scammer!</strong></p>

		<p><strong class="strong">1. How do I buy Runescape gold?</strong><br>Just choose how much gold do you want to buy and pay for it using your PayPal account. Please keep in mind that you must be the owner of the PayPal account and the credit card that you have used for your purchase. Now you are ready to contact our 24/7 Live Support team and claim your Gold! Also note that you might be asked to submit a copy of your scanned ID to confirm your identity. If you cannot provide documents when you are asked to, you will be fully refunded.</p>

		<p><strong class="strong">2. What payment methods do you accept for Runescape Gold?</strong><br>Feel free to order gold using PayPal at any time. We also accept Bitcoins, Bank wire transfers, Skrill (MoneyBookers) and Westen Union. If you want to use any payment method mentioned above, please contact our Live Support team.</p>

		<p><strong class="strong">3. Will I need to provide my ID copy?</strong><br>In most cases we do ask for ID copy. This is to prevent buyers from using stolen PayPal accounts. We will accept any personal document issued by your government confirming your identity. Remember that your information in documents must match your PayPal account’s information. All your details will be kept safely and will only be disclosed in a case of fraud.</p>

		<p><strong class="strong">4. What are chances that I will get banned?</strong><br>The possibility of getting banned is very small and it happens on very rare occasions. In fact, throughout our practice there has not been a single case when our buyer got banned for buying gold from us! However, if in an unfortunate situation it did happen, we would not take responsibility for Jagex decisions.</p>

		<p><strong class="strong">5. When I will get my gold?</strong><br>95% of orders are delivered within 5 minutes. However, if due to some circumstances we were not able to deliver gold within 24 hours, you would be fully refunded. Fortunately, this has never occurred in our practice!</p>

		<p><strong class="strong">6. How do I get my gold?</strong><br>After your payment gets processed, you need to contact our Live Support. You will be told a world name and a place where you can pick up your gold. Then, you will meet our trader in-game personally and trade him.</p>

		<p><strong class="strong">7. Are you trusted?</strong><br>We have been in this business for more than 3 years. We have more than 10,000 satisfied customers and numbers are growing. We are happy to link you to websites where you can check our feedback!</p>

		<p><strong class="strong">8. Additional information</strong><br>All trades are final. We do not own any items or gold in game. All content is property of Jagex. We only find buyers and sellers who want to exchange their real world money into in-game currency and vice versa. We reserve the right to refund orders if we believe that the purchase might be a fraud attempt. Use of VPN or Proxy is prohibited.</p>
